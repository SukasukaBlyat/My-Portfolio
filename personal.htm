        I was born in June 6, 2009 in Quezon City, entered kindergarten 
        at 5 year old and it was fun. I turn 9 year old and i was grade 4
        i was a victim of bullying becuase of my below average appearance,
        i did'nt care about them till they bully me physically, i retaliatte
        back because i felt attacked, i feel guilty and bad and good... its 
        mix to be honest however i got guidance and feel the goodness, this
        expirience give me a good lesson that, dont feel good if you done good
        feel good if what you did is morally good and be aware of consiquence.

            </a>
        </div>
        <p>
        Pandemic comes, many things become uncertain, i became more not aware
        in my emotion, i always let my emotion win over me. I became more immature
        and mature, sounds ridiculus right? well to explain its because everytime 
        i felt sad i became immature and everytiime i felt happy and calm at the same 
        time, i had a time to think why am i happy? well thats it.

        I became quite mature when i bacame 15, i understood all action of my parents
        and why they do that and that is why i felt i was a bit mature.
